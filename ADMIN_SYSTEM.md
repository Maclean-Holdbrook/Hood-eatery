# Admin System - Complete Separation

## 🎯 Overview

The admin system is now **completely separate** from the customer website. When you login as admin, you get a dedicated admin dashboard - **NOT the customer website**.

## 🔐 How It Works

### For Admin Users:
1. Login at `http://localhost:5173/login` with admin credentials
2. Automatically redirected to `http://localhost:5173/admin`
3. See **ONLY** the admin dashboard interface
4. **CANNOT** see the customer website, menu, cart, etc.
5. Different navbar with admin-specific navigation

### For Regular Users/Customers:
1. See the normal customer website
2. Can browse menu, order food, track orders
3. **CANNOT** access admin pages

## 📊 Admin Interface

When logged in as admin, you see:

### Admin Navbar (Purple):
- 🏠 **Dashboard** - Overview and statistics
- 🍔 **Menu Management** - Upload food/drink images here
- 📦 **Orders** - Manage customer orders
- 👤 **User Info** - Your name and logout button

### What Admins DON'T See:
- ❌ Customer navbar (Home, Menu, About, Contact)
- ❌ Customer footer
- ❌ Shopping cart
- ❌ Customer menu browsing page
- ❌ About/Contact pages

## 🔗 Admin URLs

**Login:**
```
http://localhost:5173/login
```

**Admin Dashboard:**
```
http://localhost:5173/admin
```

**Upload Food Images:**
```
http://localhost:5173/admin/menu
```

**Manage Orders:**
```
http://localhost:5173/admin/orders
```

## 📸 How to Upload Food Images

1. **Login as admin**
2. **Go to:** `http://localhost:5173/admin/menu`
3. **Click:** "+ Add New Item" button
4. **Fill in the form:**
   - Category: Choose from dropdown
   - Name: Food/drink name
   - Description: Brief description
   - Price: Enter price
   - **Image: Click "Choose File" and select image** 📸
   - Check "Available for order"
5. **Click:** "Add Item"

## 🎨 Visual Differences

### Admin Layout:
- **Purple gradient header** (not the customer red/orange)
- Clean dashboard interface
- Data tables and statistics
- Upload forms and management tools

### Customer Layout:
- Red/orange branding
- Product browsing
- Shopping cart
- Order checkout

## 🛡️ Security

### Admin Protection:
✅ Admin pages require authentication
✅ Admin pages check for admin role
✅ Non-admins redirected to home page
✅ Admin interface completely separated
✅ No admin links visible to customers

### Access Control:
- Admin cannot see customer UI
- Customers cannot access admin pages
- Role-based rendering
- Protected routes with authorization
